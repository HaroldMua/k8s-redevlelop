# Operator examples

This is a collection of operator examples for demonstrating some of the basic concepts of a Kubernetes Operator.

Most of examples are Kubebuilder projects, so generating code, creating CRD YAMLs and deploying code is done in the standard way.

## Why

Complex operators are too difficult to understand when someone just met the concept, but it's good to see things working instead of only reading about it.
Kubebuilder examples (CronJob, ReplicaSet) are great, but they are mostly controllers instead of an operator.
These are operator examples that I could think of and that holds on its own but still has some basic ideas of why an operator could be helpful.
